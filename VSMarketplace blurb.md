This Visual Studio 2017 extension adds a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for fast, easy and, most importantly, **visual** design 
of persistent classes. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in 
the visual model, as is the ability to add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design.

While giving you complete control over how the code is generated you'll be able to, out of the box, create sophisticated, 
consistent and **correct** Entity Framework code that can be regenerated when your model changes. And, since the code is written using 
partial classes, any additions you make to your generated code is retained across subsequent generations.

If you are used to the EF visual modeling that comes with Visual Studio, you'll be pretty much at home. The goal was to duplicate 
at least those features and, in addition, add all the little things that _should_ have been there. Things like:

*   the ability to show and hide parts of the model
*   easy customization of generated output by editing or even replacing the T4 templates
*   entities by default generated as partial classes so the generated code can be easily extended
*   class and enumeration nodes that can be colored to visually group the model
*   different concerns being generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)
*   string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer

and many other nice-to-have bits.

**ChangeLog**

1.1.0
*    Bug fixes for exceptions thrown when bad input to model attributes as text
*    Added MinLength string property (used in EF6 only as of this writing)
*    Modified attribute parser to accept MinLength
*    Added ColumnName property to model attribute
*    Added MEF extension capability !
*    Added some unit tests
*    Added some documentation updates
*    Changed version to 1.1.0 due to MEF capability

1.0.3.9

*   If no entities and model is using an unsupported inheritance strategy, changing from EF6 to EFCore doesn't give a message, just changes the strategy.
*   Added IsFlags attribute (and matching validations and behavior) to Enums
*   NGENed extension assembly

1.0.3.8

*   Fixed project item placement
*   Added change checks to diagram so dirty flag doesn't set when nothing changes

1.0.3.7

*   Emergency bug fixes

1.0.3.6

*   Fixed parser errors when editing model attributes as text
*   Fixed error when auto-generating on save and design surface is not the active window
*   Fixed crash when used on non-English-language systems (where Microsoft Pluralization Service is unavailable)
*   Added option to generate warnings if no documentation
*   Standardized warning and error message structure
*   Added ability to choose 'None' DatabaseInitializer type; generates SetInitializer(null)

1.0.3.5

*   Enhanced portability between EF6 an EFCore

1.0.3.4

*   Adds some T4 fixes to make generated code more usable in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET/) Core applications.
*   Fix to spurious error when copying/pasting enum elements.
*   First release that's available on Visual Studio Marketplace.
